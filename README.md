# a11y-map
A prototype app to test using Google's a11y map behavior with Esri's ArcGIS API for JavaScript version 4. 

## Purpose 
Use as a starting point to discusss ways to handle map accessiblity. 

## Features 

To see the a11y features tab into the map. Once you do so you'll see an extent graphic and feature list are added to the map to allow users to navigate the map content via the keyboard. At this point this is just a prototype and needs logic added to handle defining the query extent envelope size based on scale.
